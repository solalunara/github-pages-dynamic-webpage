<h1>Github Pages Dynamic Webpage</h1>

<hr>

This is a simple repository that uses github actions to allow for users to register their own accounts to a fully client-side webpage and log in using cryptography. This idea was inspired by the <a href="https://solalunara.github.io/0o0E">0o0E Scavenger Hunt</a>, which used cryptography to allow a static webpage to contain no useful information on the passkeys even when the user looked through the source code.

This webpage currently serves no other functional purpose, but may be developed in the future. It is hosted at <a href="https://solalunara.github.io/github-pages-dynamic-webpage">https://solalunara.github.io/github-pages-dynamic-webpage</a>
